## 📌 Project Summary  
This project analyses bike purchasing behaviour using demographic, income, and commute data. The aim was to create an interactive Excel dashboard that reveals key customer patterns and supports marketing, pricing, and product decisions.

## 🎯 Business Problem  
The business needed a clear understanding of:  
- Which customer segments are most likely to purchase a bike  
- What demographic and behavioural factors influence buying decisions  
- How income, region, and commute distance correlate with purchase likelihood  

These insights help guide customer segmentation, targeted marketing, and product strategy.
