# 🚴‍♂️ Bike Sales Dashboard – Customer Purchase Behaviour Analysis  
*Excel | Data Cleaning | Pivot Tables | KPI Analysis | Dashboard Design*

---

## 🟦 Introduction  
This project analyses customer purchasing behaviour in a bike retail dataset. Using demographic, income, and commute information, the goal was to identify which customer segments are most likely to purchase a bike and what factors influence their decisions.

The final result is an interactive Excel dashboard created to help marketing and customer experience teams understand buyer trends and make informed decisions about segmentation, targeting, and pricing.

## 🟩 Business Problem  
The business needed to understand:

- Which demographic groups are most likely to purchase a bike  
- How income, region, and commute distance impact buying behaviour  
- Which customer segments should be prioritised in marketing  
- How to improve customer segmentation models  

This dashboard provides clear insights that support data-driven targeting and marketing strategy.
